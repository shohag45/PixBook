# PixBook
A desktop application built using .NET Framework along with C#. The idea of this project is to user search for photographers who want them to hire for their events and personal photoshoots. The photographers can create and update their portfolio including their basic  and contact info, fees, field of expertise etc. The admin panel can manage both the users and photographers.
